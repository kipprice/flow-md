# Forest Adventure

## 1
You are walking in the forest. What do you do?
- [Look around you](#2)
- [Whistle cheerfully](#3)
- [Check my phone](#4)

## 2
There is no one around. Except...
- [Look closer](#5)

## 3
You start to whistle, only to notice a rustling sound.
- [Continue whistling](#6)
- [Look around you](#5)

## 4
Your phone is dead.
- [Okay](#5)

## 5
Out of the corner of your eye, you spot him. Shia LaBeouf.
- [Hmmm.](#7)

## 6
What kind of monster are you? Go investigate the rustling sound.
- [Okay...](#5)

## 7
He's following you about 30 feet back.
- [Wait for him](#8)
- [Keep walking](#8)
- [Start running](#8)

## 8
He gets down on all fours and breaks into a sprint. He's gaining on you!
- [Shia LaBeouf?](#9)
- [Shia LaBeouf!](#9)

## 9 
What do you do next?
- [Look for my car](#10)
- [Call for help](#11)
- [Climb a tree](#12)

## 10
You try to find your car, but you're all turned around. 
- [Look for Shia LaBeouf](#13)

## 11
Your phone is dead and there's no one else around. Did you not listen at the beginning? 
- [Throw the phone](#14)
- [Look for my car](#10)
- [Climb a tree](#12)

## 12
You look for a nearby tree that can escalate you to safety. But you're too out of shape! You can't pull yourself up to any of the nearby branches.
- [Keep trying](#15)
- [Look for Shia LaBeouf](#13)

## 13 
He's almost upon you now. You can see there's blood on his face. My God, there's blood everywhere!
- [Start singing](#16)
- [Just keep moving](#18)

## 14
The phone misses wildly. You shouldn't have skipped softball practice so many times.
- [Look for my car](#10)
- [Climb a tree](#12)

## 15
You finally reach a tree that you can essentially walk up. You start climbing, only to realize that Shia LaBeouf can just as easily climb this tree. 
- [Look for Shia LaBeouf](#13)
- [Keep Climbing](#19)

## 16
*Running for you life (from Shia LaBeouf)*

*He's brandishing a knife (It's Shia LaBeouf)*

*Lurking in the shadows*

*Hollywood superstar Shia LaBeouf*
- [Go on...](#17)

## 17
*Living in the woods (Shia LaBeouf)*

*Killing for sport (Shia LaBeouf)*

*Eating all the bodies*

*Actual cannibal Shia LaBeouf*

- [Okay, now we can keep moving](#18)

## 18
It's dark and you seem to have lost him. But you're hopelessly lost yourself, stranded with a murderer.
- [Creep silently](#20)
- [Yell for help](#21)

## 19
A branch breaks and you tumble back to the ground. Both legs are broken in the process.
- [It's all over for me](#100)

## 20
Aha! In the distance, you spot a small cottage with its light on! Hope at last!
- [Move stealthily towards it](#22)
- [Move stealthily away from it](#23)

## 21
Are you quite mad? He's sure to hear you!
- [Creep silently](#20)

## 22
Your leg! Ah! It's caught in a bear trap!
- [Try to free your leg](#25)
- [Gnaw off your leg](#24)

## 23
You try to move away, but your leg! Ah! It's caught in a bear trap! 
- [Try to free your leg](#25)
- [Gnaw off your leg](#24)

## 24
(Quiet, quiet). You start limping towards the cottage.
- [(Quiet, quiet)](#26)

## 25
You scrabble at the iron, but only manage to make things worse by getting a couple of fingers snagged as well.
- [Gnaw off all your trapped limbs](#24)
- [Give up](#100)

## 26
Now you're on the doorstep.
- [Look inside](#27)
- [Knock on the door](#28)

## 27
Sitting inside is Shia LaBeouf! He's sharpening an axe.
- [Enter quietly](#29)
- [Keep moving](#30)

## 28
You raise your hand to knock on the door, but catch a glimpse of the occupant.
- [Just knock already](#31)
- [Look inside](#27)

## 29
He doesn't hear your enter.
- [Sneak up behind him](#32)
- [Find a tourniquet](#33)

## 30
It would probably be smarter to keep moving, but you're losing blood by the liter. This cottage is your only hope.
- [Enter quietly](#29)

## 31
You knock feebly on the door. You hear footsteps, then the door swings open. Standing before you...is Shia LaBeouf.
- [Oh no](#101)

## 32
You're right behind him now. 
- [Try to strangle him](#35)
- [Knock him over the head](#36)

## 33
You glance around the cottage for a bandage that could staunch the bleeding. But the only fabric in the room are the clothes on Shia LaBeouf's back.
- [Sneak up behind him](#32)
- [Keep searching](#34)

## 34
There's nowhere left to search, but you do it anyways. In the process, you trip over a chair-leg and crash land at Shia LaBeouf's feet. He looks down at you, death in his eyes.
- [Oh no](#101)
- [Try to escape](#102)

## 35
Shia LaBeouf notices your encroaching hands and stands up to face you.
- [Fight for your life](#39)
- [Surrender](#100)

## 36
With what exactly?
- [My fists](#37)
- [A nearby chair](#38)

## 37
You attempt to knock out Shia LaBeouf, but with your blood loss, you manage only a glancing blow. He turns to face you.
- [Fight for your life](#39)
- [Surrender](#100)

## 38
There is no nearby chair except for the one Shia is sitting on.
- [Go for that chair](#40)
- [Try fists instead](#37)
- [Try strangling instead](#35)

## 39
Axe in one hand, knife in the other, Shia LaBeouf charges you.
- [Reach for the knife](#41)
- [Reach for the axe](#42)

## 40
You reach for the chair Shia is sitting upon, but accomplish nothing except alerting him to your presence.
- [Fight for your life](#39)
- [Surrender](#100)

## 41
You manage to wrestle the knife from Shia LaBeouf.
- [Stab it in his kidney](#45)
- [Stab it in his heart](#44)
- [Stab it in his eye](#46)

## 42
You grab the handle of the axe, but realize too late that it is much too heavy for you in your current state.
- [Grab the knife instead](#41)
- [Keep trying for the axe](#43)

## 43
Shia shakes you loose, knocking you to the ground in the process. The axe is raised above you...
- [Close your eyes](#101)
- [Try to escape](#102)

## 44
There is no heart to stab!
- [Stab it in his kidney](#45)
- [Stab it in his eye](#46)

## 45
Safe at last from Shia LaBeouf!
- [Phew](#99)

## 46
You miss!
- [Stab it in his kidney](#45)
- [Stab it in his heart](#44)

## 99
You limp into the woods, blood oozing from your stump leg. You have won. You have beaten Shia LaBeouf.

You have succumbed to Shia LaBeouf.
